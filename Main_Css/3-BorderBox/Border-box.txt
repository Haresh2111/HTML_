Example Of border-box

Child element contains 100% width mans as parent contains 180px (width).

> Width and height only applies to Content. Border Size and Padding size shouldn't included in width/height.

If we didn't apply border-box, it(Child) would contain 180px (width/content) + 10px padding (right) +10px padding (Left) + 5px border (right) + 5px border (left) and 200px height of content

Total width= 210px contains that Child.
Total height =200px + 5px top + 5px bottom =210px

If we apply border-box for Child, it would contains width of parent element which is 180px. And Padding and border would be included in that Widht.

So, here it would be Total=180px. (Content/Width=150 px + 10px border +20px padding)
And Content_height would be Total of content =200px -10px bordr(5px left and 5px right) =190px 


> Margin wouldn't be considered under Border-box.
